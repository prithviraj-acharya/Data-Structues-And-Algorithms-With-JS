/**
 Longest Mountain Subarray

 Problem Statement
You are given an array of 'N' integers denoting the heights of the mountains. 
You need to find the length of the longest subarray which has the shape of a mountain.

A mountain subarray is defined as a subarray which consists of elements that are initially in ascending order 
until a peak element is reached and beyond the peak element all other elements of the subarray are in decreasing order.
 
If the given array is: [1 3 1 4]. The longest mountain subarray would be 3. 
This is because the longest mountain is  [1 3 1] having length 3.

4
1 3 1 4
6
1 3 1 4 3 1
3
3 1 3


3
4
0

The first test case is already explained in the problem statement.
The second test case, the given array is: [1 3 1 4 3 1] and the longest mountain would be of length: 4 i.e. 1 4 3 1.
The third test case, the given array is: [3 1 3] and the longest mountain would be of length: 0 
since there is no increasing, peak and decreasing subarray.
