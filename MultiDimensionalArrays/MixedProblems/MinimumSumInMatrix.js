/**
 * Problem Statement: You are given a 2D matrix ‘ARR’ of size ‘N x 3’ having integers, where ‘N’ is the number
   of rows.  Your task is to find the smallest sum possible while taking one element from each row.  The rules
   for selecting elements are as follows-

   1. In a row, after selecting an element at a given position, you cannot select the element directly below
      it.
   2. You can only select elements that are not directly below the previously selected element.
